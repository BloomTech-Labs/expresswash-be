# Data Model

The Register Washer and Client Endpoints need the following JSON information (with the exception of streetAddress2, which is not required):

{
	"email":"test@test.con",
	"firstName":"Test",
	"lastName":"Testerson",
	"password":"1234",
	"phoneNumber":"1234567890",
	"streetAddress":"1051 Market St",
	"streetAddress2":"APT 240",
	"city":"San Francisco",
	"State":"California", 
	"zip":"94103"
}

The Login User Endpoint needs the following JSON information:

{
	"email":"test@test.con",
	"password":"1234"
}


#### USERS

---

```
{
  id: UUID,
  email: STRING,
  first_name: STRING,
  last_name: STRING,
  password: STRING,
  phoneNumber: STRING,
  streetAddress: STRING,
  streetAddress2: STRING,
  city: STRING,
  state: STRING,
  zip: STRING,
  userType: STRING [ 'admin', 'washer', 'client' ],
}
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

Currently no actions are coded for the server.

Tests are coded using Jest and Supertest for all of the endpoints.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    *  PORT - set the port you wish the server to run on on your local machine
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
